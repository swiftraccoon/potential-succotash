I want to build a NodeJS website. It will utilize `https`. It will be end-to-end encrypted. The pages will be:
- Login page
-- utilize webauthn to allow yubikey/face ID
-- offer registration button. button redirects to registration page

- Home page
-- a search bar to search our transcribed audio
-- a link to our Subscription page where users can enter text they'd like to be alerted on via email.
-- a drop-down selector where we display available CSS styles for users to choose
-- a collapsible container that displays some links where users can listen the feeds
-- the main body/feature is the auto-updating table of transcriptions. the table features 30 most recent transcriptions. the table headers are date/time, play button (to play the audio), talkgroup ID, radio ID, and transcription. we auto-update the table without refreshing the page as new transcriptions are incoming.

- Search results page
-- when users peform a search in the Home page, we display the results in a search results page
-- search results are styled and displayed as they are on the Home page

- Subscription page
-- the first container is for subscribing
---- there are two text boxes: a regex for us to test transcriptions against and one that accepts an email where we send the transcription to when there is a match
---- there is a button the user presses to submit the subscription
---- we require users activate this subscription by clicking to the email that contains a unique activation code to prove they got the email
-- the second container is for listing active subscriptions and allowing users to deactivate a subscription
---- we list all subscriptions linked to the user's account. each subscription has a check box next to it showing whether or not it's enabled/disabled.
---- we allow users to enable/disable via the checkbox and hit an "update" button to save the state of the subscriptions

- Registration page
-- it is one container
---- the container has three text boxes: first name, last name, email
---- a link to the terms of service and a checkbox saying you agree to them
---- a submission button 
---- we send a link to the listed email with an activation link that contains a unique activation code so we can confirm it's a real email
